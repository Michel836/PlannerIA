# Project Management Best Practices

This document contains essential project management guidelines and best practices that can be referenced during project planning.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Guidelines

### Key Principles
- Break down work into manageable chunks
- Each task should be 8-40 hours of work
- Use the 100% rule - child tasks must add up to parent
- Maintain 3-4 levels of decomposition maximum

### WBS Structure
1. **Level 1**: Project phases (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closing)
2. **Level 2**: Major deliverables within each phase
3. **Level 3**: Work packages (specific tasks)
4. **Level 4**: Activities (detailed steps)

## Estimation Techniques

### Three-Point Estimation
- **Optimistic (O)**: Best-case scenario
- **Pessimistic (P)**: Worst-case scenario  
- **Most Likely (M)**: Most realistic scenario
- **Formula**: (O + 4M + P) / 6

### Analogous Estimation
- Use historical data from similar projects
- Apply scaling factors based on project differences
- Most effective for high-level estimates

### Parametric Estimation
- Use statistical relationships between variables
- Examples: Lines of code, square footage, function points
- Requires historical data and defined parameters

## Risk Management Framework

### Risk Categories
1. **Technical Risks**: Technology failures, integration issues
2. **Schedule Risks**: Delays, resource conflicts
3. **Budget Risks**: Cost overruns, scope creep
4. **Resource Risks**: Skill gaps, availability issues
5. **External Risks**: Market changes, regulatory updates

### Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Probability Scale**: 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
- **Impact Scale**: 1 (Minimal) to 5 (Severe)
- **Risk Score**: Probability Ã— Impact
- **Priority**: High (15-25), Medium (8-14), Low (1-7)

## Project Phases

### 1. Initiation (5-10% of project)
- Project charter development
- Stakeholder identification
- High-level requirements gathering
- Feasibility analysis

### 2. Planning (20-30% of project)
- Detailed scope definition
- WBS creation
- Schedule development
- Resource planning
- Risk assessment
- Communication planning

### 3. Execution (60-70% of project)
- Work performance
- Quality assurance
- Team management
- Stakeholder communication
- Issue resolution

### 4. Monitoring & Control (Throughout project)
- Progress tracking
- Change control
- Risk monitoring
- Performance reporting
- Corrective actions

### 5. Closing (5% of project)
- Final deliverable acceptance
- Contract closure
- Lessons learned
- Team release
- Project documentation

## Common Project Metrics

### Schedule Metrics
- **Schedule Variance (SV)**: Earned Value - Planned Value
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: Earned Value / Planned Value
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Longest sequence of dependent tasks

### Cost Metrics
- **Cost Variance (CV)**: Earned Value - Actual Cost
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: Earned Value / Actual Cost
- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**: Total planned budget

### Quality Metrics
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per unit of work
- **First Pass Yield**: Percentage of work completed correctly first time
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Stakeholder feedback scores

## Technology Project Considerations

### Software Development
- Use Agile methodologies for iterative development
- Plan for testing phases (unit, integration, system, UAT)
- Consider DevOps practices for CI/CD
- Account for technical debt and refactoring

### Infrastructure Projects
- Include hardware procurement lead times
- Plan for testing and staging environments
- Consider security and compliance requirements
- Account for deployment and rollback procedures

### Data Projects
- Include data discovery and profiling phases
- Plan for data quality and validation
- Consider privacy and governance requirements
- Account for user training and change management
